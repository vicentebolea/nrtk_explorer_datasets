The data cover the entire land area of the State of Indiana, or 36,418 square miles, more or less. Data are delivered in county sets, consisting of 4000'x4000' uncompressed 24-bit natural color TIFF files.  The MrSID files were created from these data Accuracy is better than 5' at the 95% confidence level for 1-foot data and better than 2.5' at the 95% confidence level for 6-inch data based on a NSSDA accuracy assessment (a complete accuracy report is documented under the Accuracy and Completeness Report section in this metadata record). The entire perimeter of the State is buffered by at least 1,000 feet. The border with Illinois along the Wabash River, and Kentucky along the Ohio River is buffered a minimum distance of 1,000' or to the opposite river bank, whichever distance is greater.  Border areas of the State proximate to Lake Michigan (Lake, Porter and LaPorte Counties) are buffered beyond the shoreline a minimum distance of 2,500'.  Adjacent flight lines overlap by a minimum of 30 percent; the downtown areas in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne sidelap 60 to 80% in order to produce &quot;true&quot; orthoimagery in which building lean has been eliminated.  Imagery was collected with the Leica ADS40 digital pushbroom sensor and processed with the ISTAR system. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxxyyyyH = high resolution photos (e.g., 6-inch); xxxxyyyyL = low res photos (e.g., 1-foot), where xxxx and yyyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet, divided by 1000, of the tile origin (the top-left pixel). 1-foot MRSID files are approximately 2.3 MB in size. 6-inch MRSID files are approximately 8 MB in size.

ISTAR digital surface modeling is based on anauto correlated pixel-matching system within the ISTARsoftware. The auto correlated digital surface model (DSM)surface represents the initial surface model. Thissurface is then exported from the UNIX format into aMicroStation compatible format. The techniques used toprocess the ISTAR DSM (auto correlated surface model)are similar to those used for lidar processing. EarthData hasdeveloped a unique method for processing DSM data toidentify and remove the majority of elevation points fallingon vegetation, buildings, and other above groundstructures for generation of the Digital Elevation Model(DEM). The algorithms for filtering data were utilizedwithin EarthData's proprietary software and commercialsoftware suite of tools provides efficient processing for smallto large-scale, projects and has been incorporated into ISO9001 compliant production work flows. The following is astep-by-step breakdown of the process.1. Using the DSM ISTAR data set created by EarthData,the technician performed a visual inspection of the data toverify that the flight lines met correctly. The technicianalso verified that there were no voids, and that the datacovered the project limits. The technician then selected aseries of areas from the dataset and inspected them whereadjacent flight lines met. This DSM surface is used in therectification of True Ortho imagery.2. A process, which utilizes 3-D Analyst and EarthData'sproprietary software was run to detect and color code thedifferences in elevation values and profiles. The technicianreviewed this information and located the areas thatcontained systematic errors or distortions that needed to beremoved for creation of a ground ortho.3. Systematic distortions highlighted in step 2 wereremoved and the data were re-inspected.  Correctionsand adjustments can involve the application of angulardeflection or compensation for curvature of the groundsurface that can be introduced by crossing from one typeof land cover to another.4.The data were checked against the control network toensure that vertical requirements were maintained.5. The resulting product is a digital elevation model (DEM).This DEM has been through an automated filtering routineto remove the majority of noise and above ground features.Some above ground features and noise may still exist in thefinal DEM data set. The DEM was used in the rectificationof ground orthos.6. The final DSM and DEM data sets were converted toERDAS Imagine format and cut to the same tile layout asthe final digital orthophotos.7. Data was delivered on firewire drive by EarthData andDVD by Pinnacle.&quot;</dd><dt><em>Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  Digital Surface Model</dt><dt><em>Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  Digital Elevation Model</dt><dt><em>Process_Date:</em>  20051024</dt><dt><em>Source_Produced_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  DSM and DEM</dt><dt><em>Process_Contact:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Organization_Primary:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Organization:</em>  EarthData International</dt><dt><em>Contact_Person:</em>  Raquel Charrois</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Contact_Position:</em>  Project Manager</dt><dt><em>Contact_Address:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Address_Type:</em>  mailing and physical address</dt><dt><em>Address:</em>  7320 Executive Way</dt><dt><em>City:</em>  Frederick</dt><dt><em>State_or_Province:</em>  MD</dt><dt><em>Postal_Code:</em>  21704</dt><dt><em>Country:</em>  USA</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Contact_Voice_Telephone:</em>  (301)-948-8550</dt><dt><em>Contact_Facsimile_Telephone:</em>  (301)-963-2064</dt><dt><em>Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address:</em>  rcharrois@earthdata.com</dt><dt><em>Hours_of_Service:</em>  Mon - Fri 9:00 am to 5:00 pm</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Process_Step:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Process_Description:</em>  <dd>&quot;The digital orthophotography is comprised of a 6-inch pixelresolution ground orthos for the counties of Dubois, Elkhart,Floyd,  Hamilton, Kosciusko, Lake, LaPorte, Marion,Monroe, Perry, Steuben, Tippecanoe and Vanderburgh anda 1-foot pixel resolution ground ortho for the remainder ofthe State. True Ortho imagery was generated in the areasof downtown Indianapolis and downtown Fort Wayne.Once the DSM data for the true ortho areas and DEM datafor the ground ortho areas were integrated into the ISTARsystem the initial radiometric adjustments were performed onthe imagery for each flight line attempting to reach the bestpossible histogram. The rectification process was run usingthe processed DSM or DEM surface and the radiometricallybalanced imagery on each flight line. A second set ofradiometric adjustments were made and mosaic lines wereplaced. QA/QC was performed looking for smears and otherindications of problems within the digital orthophotocreation process. The final imagery data set is removedfrom the ISTAR environment in a process called&quot;packaging&quot; where the individual tiles are created. Thecreated tiles are reviewed again for anomalies andinteractive radiometric adjustment applied where needed.The final digital ortho product was TIFF with TFW.Data was delivered on firewire drive and DVD.&quot;</dd><dt><em>Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  Digital Orthophotos</dt><dt><em>Process_Date:</em>  20051024</dt><dt><em>Source_Produced_Citation_Abbreviation:</em>  Digital Orthos</dt><dt><em>Process_Contact:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Information:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Organization_Primary:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Contact_Organization:</em>  EarthData International</dt><dt><em>Contact_Person:</em>  Raquel Charrois</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Contact_Position:</em>  Project Manager</dt><dt><em>Contact_Address:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Address_Type:</em>  mailing and physical address</dt><dt><em>Address:</em>  7320 Executive Way</dt><dt><em>City:</em>  Frederick</dt><dt><em>State_or_Province:</em>  MD</dt><dt><em>Postal_Code:</em>  21704</dt><dt><em>Country:</em>  USA</dt></dl></dd><dt><em>Contact_Voice_Telephone:</em>  301-948-8550</dt><dt><em>Contact_Electronic_Mail_Address:</em>  rcharrois@earthdata.com</dt><dt><em>Hours_of_Service:</em>  Mon - Fri 9:00 am to 5:00 pm</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><em>Process_Step:</em>  <dd><dl><dt><em>Process_Description:</em>  <dd>&quot;The final 1-foot and 6-inch digital orthophotography TIFF tiles werecompressed (encoded) into MrSID Generation 3 (MG3) compressed formatusing LizardTechs proprietary GeoExpress 5 software.
